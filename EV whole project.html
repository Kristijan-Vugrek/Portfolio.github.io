				<h1>Python</h1>

				<p> When I began this project, a significant challenge emerged that was the lack of an available dataset. Fortunately, I discovered the Electromaps website, which housed comprehensive information about all the charging stations in Croatia.
					However, dealing with the abundance of stations and details made manual entry into an Excel sheet impractical. <br />
					<br />
					To overcome this obstacle, I turned to web scraping as the most viable solution.<br /> 
					Despite my lack of prior experience in Python or data scraping, I sought guidance from resources such as YouTube tutorials, Stack Overflow discussions, Reddit forums, and assistance from ChatGPT. <br />
					Undeterred, I delved into writing a script in Jupyter Notebooks using BeautifulSoup. After weeks of persistent coding and problem-solving, I successfully developed a functional script capable of extracting data from the Electromaps site, that was a pivotal achievement in advancing my project.	<br />		<br />	    
					Major hurdles cropped up when dealing with the "(load more)" buttons to reveal all the counties and stations on the site. Additionally, the site's sporadic refreshing posed another challenge (I'm still unsure why it happened, but hey, I managed to grab my data despite it).

				  <h1>Excel</h1>

	              <p> 
					I used Excel to combine several tables into one dataset. After that, I used Excel to clean and organize the dataset, making sure the information was accurate and consistent.

				<h1>SQL</h1>
				

				<p> 
					Leveraging SQL proved useful for conducting calculations in preparation for future projects.
					Specifically, I merged data regarding registered electric vehicles (EVs) by county with the respective count of stations in each county. <br />
					This enabled me to compute the percentage of stations relative to registered EVs a county by county. <br />
					This dataset is readily adaptable for visualization, offering a clear representation of the relationship between registered EVs and charging stations across various counties.

			<h1>Tableau</h1>

            <p>
																				
				Utilizing Tableau, I developed an interactive dashboard that goes beyond static visualizations. 
				The "EVs to Stations Ratio" and "Total number of charging stations and registered EVs by county in 2022" charts are designed for dynamic exploration. <br />
				By incorporating interactive features, users can delve deeper into the data simply by clicking on specific elements within the charts.<br />
				The map displaying the EV to stations ratio further enhances the interactive experience, allowing users to pinpoint and examine specific regions for a more detailed understanding of the project's results.<br />
